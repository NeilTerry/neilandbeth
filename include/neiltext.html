<p>Neil was born in 1982 to Ronald Terry and his Scottish wife Sandra in Honolulu, HI, and is the eldest sibling of Craig and Alison Terry. Ron's career in the Navy allowed Neil to grow up bouncing around the globe, with stops in Italy, Florida, England, Maine, and Florida a second time. With his father's family concentrated in his hometown of Orient, NY and his mother's family on the northeast coast of Scotland, travel was a major part of all family holidays and many of Neil's best memories.</p>
<p>While in high school in Florida, Neil developed a passion for golf and tennis, two of his favorite hobbies to this day, and also played in the Jacksonville Youth Symphony Orchestra.</p>

<p>In 2006, Neil returned to Duke to pursue his Ph.D in Biomedical Engineering and multiple intramural softball titles. It was at Duke the second time where he met a number of additional groomsmen, one of whom, John, was responsible for connecting him with Beth for the first time when they took a trip to Florida to attend the Georgia-Florida football game and meet John's college friends.
