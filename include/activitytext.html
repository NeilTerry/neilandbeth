<h3>Grandfather Mountain</h3>
<p>Adjacent to Linville Ridge, Grandfather Mountain is located on the eastern escarpment of the Blue Ridge Mountains and the site of a North Carolina State Park. The park contains a museum, the famous "mile-high swinging bridge", and views of up to 100 miles on a clear day. The backcountry on the mountain is the location of a large number of hiking trails, including one that allows for the view of the famous grandfather profile of the mountain (Neil force-marched Beth up this trail in the summer of 2009 on a 4-hour hike).</p>

<h3>Blowing Rock</h3>
<p>Blowing Rock, located just north of Linville in the Blue Ridge Mountains takes its name from an unusual rock formation that juts over 1,500 ft. above the Johns River gorge. Due to the rock's shape and size, wind currents from the gorge often blow vertically, causing light objects to float upwards in the sky.</p>
<p>The town of Blowing Rock itself provides access to the Blowing Rock Observation Deck, the Blowing Rock Art & History Museum, and much more.</p>
