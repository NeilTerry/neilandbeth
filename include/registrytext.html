<p>While there are many pairs of shoes and electronic gadgets that we constantly crave, Beth and I are fortunate enough to not need for anything significant.  We are healthy (or in Neil's case, healthy + 25 lbs.), happy, and live full lives. Your attendance during this wonderful weekend is all we could ever ask for. In leiu of a wedding gift, we would appreciate if those of you who are able to could donate to UMAR, a non-profit that provides group homes and enrichment opportunities for those with developmental disabilities in western North Carolina. Mary Gray, Beth's sister and bridesmaid, lives in a UMAR group home. The following link will take you to UMAR's donation portal (please designate your donation towards group homes and indicate that you are giving in the name of Neil and Beth Terry).</p>

<p>For those of you who may feel more comfortable giving a traditional wedding gift, we have registered at a number of locations. Again, please do not feel compelled to give us a wedding gift, as your presence is all we ask.</p>
