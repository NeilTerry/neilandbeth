<div class="Left">
<p>Beth grew up in Charlotte, NC and is the daughter of two loving parents, Max and Marshall. She grew up with 3 older sisters, Jenny, Mary Gray, and Marty. Having four girls around the same age may have driven her parents crazy, however, this made for a very fun childhood and eventually Beth’s sisters became her best friends.</p>

<p>Beth attended a University of Georgia football game while she was a senior in High School and instantly knew that she wanted to be a bulldog. She attended the University of Georgia from 2002 to 2006. During this time she met 5 of her bridesmaids who were all Delta Zeta’s with her at UGA. Beth will always be grateful for her experience at UGA as she was able to find a major that was able to fulfill her passion for helping people and also challenge her academically, Family Financial Management. Her dad is also thankful that she attended UGA as this is where she finally developed a love for football.
Beth is currently a Financial Advisor at Merrill Lynch and has a love of great food, good music, planning parties, water skiing, and traveling.</p>
