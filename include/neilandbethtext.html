<p>Beth and Neil met through mutual friends at the World’s Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party (or sometimes referred to as Georgia/Florida) in Jacksonville, FL in 2008. After they were introduced by now bridesmaid, Christa, and groomsman, John, they were inseparable for the rest of the weekend. Beth realized she liked Neil when Georgia lost the football game and she didn’t care because she wanted to continue getting to know Neil. We are sure more stories about this memorable weekend will be told during the wedding weekend!</p>

<p>Beth was working in Atlanta, GA at the time while Neil was getting his Ph.D. at Duke in Durham, NC. Neil drove to Atlanta a few times “on his way” to and from his parents’ house in Jacksonville, FL to see Beth. Eventually they developed a relationship with each other and were traveling nonstop. After a few years, Neil got a job in Baltimore, MD and Beth moved with him. After being in the same city for a few years, Neil decided that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with Beth. Neil proposed to Beth on September 25th, 2013 when he got down on one knee in Annapolis, MD. Beth said “YES!” and they have been busy wedding planning ever since!</p>
