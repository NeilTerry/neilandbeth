<p>The proximity of Linville Ridge to Sugar Mountain, one of North Carolina's most popular ski resorts means that there are a large number of accommodation options. Rooms are available in multiple hotels in the area, and rental properties that are typically in high demand during the winter ski months have great availability (at incredibly reasonable prices) during the wedding weekend. Furthermore, private homes are available for rental periods of a week or longer at both Linville Ridge and Grandfather Mountain country clubs.<p>
