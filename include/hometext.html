<p>It was a long time coming, but we are finally engaged and have set a wedding date of June 28, 2014. Neither of us can wait, and we look forward to sharing the exciting occasion with all of you.  We realize that few of you are familiar with the Linvlle area of North Carolina; hopefully this website will help with some of those details. Please see see each of the pages linked above for more information about the event, accommodations, our friends and family, and us. If you have any additional questions that aren't covered, please feel free to give Neil or Beth a call or send them an email.</p>

<p>If you would like to leave a message or follow along as we prepare for the event, please follow the two of us on our joint Twitter account at @NeilBethWedding.</p>
